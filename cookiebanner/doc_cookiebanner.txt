CookieBanner for FlatPress
==========================

Description
-----------
The plugin displays a banner at the bottom of the browser to comply with the obligation to provide information and consent (EU-Cookie-Directive), which informs the visitor about the use of cookies.
Also activates a reference to the privacy policy in the contact form and when commenting.

Important note
--------------
The banner contains a link to the privacy policy.
To do this, it is necessary that you create a new static page with the page-name “dataprotection” with your privacy policy in the Admin Center of FlatPress.

In the current development version of FlatPress 1.3, the anchor {comment_form} is missing in the template contact.tpl.
See https://github.com/flatpressblog/flatpress/blob/master/fp-interface/sharedtpls/contact.tpl
This must be inserted before the closing </fieldset> element in line 51
Users of ≤ FlatPress 1.2.1 do not need to make any change in the template.
