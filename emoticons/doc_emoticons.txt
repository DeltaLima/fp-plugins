Emoticons-Plugin
================

Thanks for the template to Edoardo Vacchi (NoWhereMan)

In posts or comments, if certain strings are enclosed by spaces or the strings are at the end of a line, the strings will be replaced with emoticons.

Example:
Text ;) Text
Text :wink: Text
Text 1F609

A list of markdown emoji markups is available at the following link: https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908
You can choose from 1116 emoticons, which are located in the plugin directory emoticons/img/.
The Google font "Noto Emoji" and its derivatives are licensed under the SIL Open Font License (OFL).   

The strings can be customized in the plugin PHP script.
