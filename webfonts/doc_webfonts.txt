Webfonts-Plugin
===============

Description
-----------
This plugin ensures that the Google Webfonts
Open Sans, Noto Sans, Noto Sans Mono, Ubuntu Mono and Playfair Display
are provided on your web server in a GDPR-safe manner.

With the help of web fonts you can use any font in web design.
The WOFF format (Web Open Font Format) was declared a standard by the W3C in 2012 and is supported by modern browsers.
With its container structure, it offers the advantage that True Type fonts are compressed without loss and
additional information about the license can be supplied. The successor WOFF2 is the standard today.
